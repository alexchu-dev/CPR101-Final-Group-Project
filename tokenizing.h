Purpose:        This module is to tokenize a string by using strtok() and split them into tokens by using delimiters. The codes written use a space " " as a delimiters to separate a string into words and output them one by one giving the order number respectively. By upgrading the codes, it could be working with data files and output the data which use delimiters. E.g. An input as "Hello World" would be split down to "Hello" and "World".
